Quick start guide.

1) Install a fresh raspian on a SD card.  I use 32 Gig High speed cards.
   Below is how I did it on my mac:
  download from: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

 diskutil list
 diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk3
 sudo dd bs=1m if=/Users/jml/Downloads/2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch.img of=/dev/rdisk3
 diskutil eject /dev/disk3

2) install the card in a pi3 with keybopard mouse, monitor and network access.

3) Boot, open a terminal and "sudo raspi-config"
  a) set a host name (suggestion repeater call and primary frequency)
  b) configure wifi if needed
  c) Localsation options
     I1) Local  disable en_GB and select en_US.UTF-8, also select as default local
     I2) set time zone
     I3) change kepboard layout, select 104 key keyboard, English (US), English (US) a second time, defaul layout, no compose key, no (to terminate the x server)
     I4) Wifi Country select US
  c) interfacing options.
     P2) enable SSH
     P3) I enable the VNC server so we can run the GUI remotely.
     P4) Enable SPI
     P5) Enable I2C
     P6) Disable login on serial and serial port, we done use it, the pin are using elswere in the PiRpt
  d) Finish and reboot

4) open a terminal and install PiPtr code
   git clone https://github.com/jmlzone/PiPtr

5) auto get all needed updates and package dependancies for PiPtr
  cd PiPrt
  ./setup.sh


6) Create a config template and edit as needed
   cd python
   sudo ./main.py -w
   sudo chown pi.pi <the newly created template file>

  edit with your favoriate editor the newly created template.

  if you are not using a piptr board but USB sound cards, edit the
  <cardWait> to the numer of cards you actually have

  Set the call sign(s) and other values as needed

  edit the sound caerd device names as needed (aplay -L | grep sysdefault)

7) run PiPtr with your configuration
  sudo ./main.py
