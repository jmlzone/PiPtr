This is the README for the Pi Repeater project.  The Goal of this
project is to develope an inexpensive linking repeater controller
witha cost of aproximatly $50/port vs current commerical solutions
which are closer to $160/port.

This is an extensable linkable controller with both local and remote
linking.

For information on the mmra network see mmra.org
for information on this project contact N1DDK@arrl.net.

Most of the code will be in Python, however some of it is in C.

Eventually there will be good documeation and a bug/enhancement
tracking WIKI or some such thing.
