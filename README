This is the README for the Rasberry Pi Ham Hadio Repeater Controller
project.  The Goal of this project is to develop an inexpensive
linking repeater controller witha cost of aproximatly $50/port vs
current commerical solutions which are closer to $160/port.

This is an extensable linkable controller with both local and remote
linking.

For information on the mmra network see mmra.org
for information on this project contact N1DDK@arrl.net.

Most of the code will be in Python, however some of it is in C.

Eventually there will be good documeation and a bug/enhancement
tracking WIKI or some such thing.

Current state: The tets repeater is stable on the air but mnay many
things are still to be done.
